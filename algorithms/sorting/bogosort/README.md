# Bogosort - bogus sorting algorithm
Bogosort is an inefficient sorting algorithms which bases on a pure luck. It sorts data by randomly shuffling it and checking if it was sorted by shuffling procedure or not.
 
* Memory complexity O(1)
* Best case performance O(1) - if you are lucky :-)
* Worst case performance O(âˆž) - if you are unlucky :-(
* Average performance O(n*n!)
