# Pancake sort 


We are given a stack of n pancakes, each of different size.  Our goal is to sort this stack from  smallest  to  largest 
(largest  being  on  the  bottom  of  the  stack).   The  only  thing we are allowed to do is to insert the spatula in between 
two pancakes (or between the bottom pancake and the plate), and flip over all the pancakes that are on top of the spatula.
